# Secret Santa 🎅🏼

With gatherings getting harder to happen due to the ongoing pandemic, there
should still be a way to organize Secret Santa. Now you can do it in a friendly
realtime chat app!

## Usage

* Clone the repository
* Into the root directory run `npm install` to download all dependencies
* Then run `npm run start` to launch a local server.
* To launch a development server which reloads on save, run `npm run dev`

On the landing page you can create a new room. Whoever creates it will be the
admin of the room. (The admin can trigger the Secret Santa shuffle).

To add other people to the room, simply copy and paste the room URL and send it
to them 😁.

To stop the local server hit `ctrl + c` in the terminal window.

## Future plans

Every contribution is more than welcome! The documentation and roadmap is under
development, so until then please open an issue first to make sure that whatever
you want to add is conform to the project vision.
